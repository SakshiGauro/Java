# Variable Assignment
```java
int dogs = 7;
int cats = 15;

System.out.println("1.Dogs: " + dogs);
System.out.println("1. Cats: " + cats);
```
- declaring the variables `cats` and `dogs` and assigning them 7 and 15 respectively.
- printing the stored value of `dogs` and `cats` on the console.

```java
cats = dogs;
```
- assigning the value of `dogs` (7) to `cats`. Now, `cats` have the value of 7 too.

### Printing
```java
System.out.println("2. Dogs: " + dogs);
System.out.println("2. Cats: " + cats);
```
- prints
```
2. Dogs: 7
2. Cats: 7
```
